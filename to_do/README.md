# DBaaS vs DIY
Below is an outlined pros and con lists of using a managed DBaaS like Cloud SQL or AWS RDS versus our current implementation of using Persistent Volume Claim PVC with Postgres Setup. This comparism depends heavily on the use case and requirements of our workloads. That being said, I’ll try to highlight where trade-offs tend to matter most. 

## DBaas 
### Pros 
1. Operational Buden is Much Lower
From OS management? to high availability to security, the cloud provider handles most of these for us. Hence we dont have to worry  about backups, upgrades, patching?, encryption at rest, network isolation, replication, and failover automation, they come built-in with the service.

2. Scalability, Performance and Reliability
Good vertical scaling; horizontal scaling (read replicas) is usually supported but with constraints. Some services auto-scale storage.
The provider typically guarantees durability SLAs, consistent backups, transactional integrity, etc

3. Time to deploy / ease of use
Faster. You spin up a managed instance, connect, maybe configure replicas, and go.

4. Backup and restore
With a managed database service like Google Cloud SQL, backups are fully automated and integrated into the platform. Daily backups, point-in-time recovery, and offsite storage are handled transparently, ensuring data durability without manual setup. Restores are simple—often just a few clicks—and the service automatically manages retention policies and consistency, reducing the risk of human error or data loss.

### Cons
1. Control
Limited. You often can’t control OS level settings, certain Postgres extensions, fine-grained tuning of IO paths, or internals of storage. Might not support certain Postgres extensions, custom file system options, or exotic configurations.
Upgrades might be constrained or must follow the provider’s supported versions. You may lack ability to jump major versions or use bleeding-edge features.

2. Cost
You pay a premium for the managed service. You pay for instance hours, storage, IOPS, possibly replication, network traffic, backups, etc.

3. Vendor lock-in / portability
Higher lock-in. If you depend heavily on managed features (backups, replicas, managed replicas, etc.), migrating out can be hard.


## PVC + Postgres
### Pros
1. Control
Full. You control Postgres version, extensions, OS/kernel parameters, mount options, tuning, etc. You can run almost any extension or custom configuration you need.
You have full control; can upgrade when you want, run custom versions or forks, apply patches.

2. Cost
Potentially cheaper at scale if optimized well, because you’re only paying for infrastructure components (compute + storage) without a “management tax.” But hidden costs (engineer time, potential downtime) can erode that advantage.

3. Vendor lock-in / portability
Higher lock-in. If you depend heavily on managed features (backups, replicas, managed replicas, etc.), migrating out can be hard.

### Cons
1. Operational Buden is Much Higher
You must build (or adopt) tooling and processes for backups, point-in-time recovery, reHA/replication, manage failover logic, sharding, monitoring, upgrades, etc. encryption, network policies, RBAC, certificate management, securing backups

2. Scalability, Performance and Reliability
You can scale more flexibly (within Kubernetes & your storage limits) and optimize for your workload. However, you must manage replication, sharding, and capacity planning yourself.
At small-to-moderate scale, the performance disadvantage of DBaaS might be negligible. But once you push high IOPS, high throughput, low latency, complex queries, huge data sets, or multi-zone writes, the disadvantages (network overhead, abstraction layers) of a managed service may become more noticeable.
You are responsible; mistakes in storage class, PV provisioning, volume scaling, or operator bugs can lead to data loss.

3. Time to deploy / ease of use
Slower. You must design the deployment (statefulset + PVCs, storage class, operator or custom scripts), test failure modes, set up HA, etc.

4. Backup and restore
Running your own Postgres in Kubernetes means taking full responsibility for backup strategy, scheduling, and storage management. You must configure and maintain tools like pgBackRest or Wal-G, handle WAL archiving, and ensure consistency across PersistentVolumes. Testing and automating restores are also on you, adding complexity and operational risk. Without disciplined monitoring and regular validation, it’s easy for backups to silently fail or become unusable when you need them most.

## In conclusion
Managed DBaaS (Pro):
Using a managed database service like Google Cloud SQL drastically reduces operational complexity. Backups, patching, failover, scaling, and monitoring are all automated and integrated into the cloud ecosystem. You can focus on application logic instead of managing database lifecycles, and rely on the provider’s SLAs for reliability and recovery. This approach ensures consistent performance and security updates without manual intervention.

Self-hosted Postgres on Kubernetes (Con):
Running Postgres inside Kubernetes gives you full control but also full responsibility. You must manage backups, replication, scaling, and — yes — patching as part of the operational burden. That means tracking new Postgres releases, rebuilding container images, rolling out upgrades safely across StatefulSets, and testing for compatibility. Without careful management, the risk of downtime, configuration drift, or data inconsistency increases significantly compared to a managed service.
