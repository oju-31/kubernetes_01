# DBaaS vs DIY
Below is an outlined pros and cons list of using a managed DBaaS like Cloud SQL or AWS RDS versus our current implementation of using Persistent Volume Claim PVC with Postgres Setup. This comparison depends heavily on the use case and requirements of our workloads. That being said, I’ll try to highlight where trade-offs tend to matter most. 

## DBaaS
### Pros 
1. The operational burden is much lower.
From OS management to high availability to security, the cloud provider handles most of these for us. Hence, we don't have to worry about backups, upgrades, patching, encryption at rest, network isolation, replication, and failover automation; they come built-in with the service.

2. Scalability, Performance and Reliability
It comes with excellent vertical scaling; horizontal scaling (read replicas) is usually supported but with constraints. Some services auto-scale storage. Also, cloud providers typically guarantee durability SLAs (99.95% uptime for instances configured for high availability (HA), e.g., on Google Cloud SQL), consistent backups, transactional integrity, etc.

3. Time to Deploy / Ease of Use
Time to deploy is much faster with DaaS. Spin up a managed instance, connect, maybe configure replicas, and that’s it — we’re good to go. It’s relatively easy to use too, as these services come with lots of tutorials and documentation. Google Cloud, for example, has step-by-step tutorials built into their console with an option to turn whatever is deployed there into code (IaC).

4. Backup and Restore
With a managed database service like Google Cloud SQL, backups are fully automated and integrated into the platform. Daily backups, point-in-time recovery, and offsite storage are handled transparently, ensuring data durability without manual setup. Restores are simple (often just a few clicks), and the service automatically manages retention policies and consistency, reducing the risk of human error or data loss.

### Cons

1. Control
With all the operational management abstraction comes limited control. We most likely won’t be able to control OS-level settings, certain Postgres extensions, fine-grained tuning of I/O paths, or storage internals. The service might not support certain Postgres extensions, custom file system options, or exotic configurations. Upgrades might also be constrained or must follow the provider’s supported versions. We may also lack the ability to jump major versions or use bleeding-edge features.

2. Cost
We pay a premium for the managed service. Almost every operation or feature comes with a price tag — we pay for instance hours, storage, IOPS, possibly replication, network traffic, backups, etc.

3. Vendor Lock-in / Portability
Using a managed service puts us at a higher risk of vendor lock-in. Personally, I don’t see this as much of an issue because offerings from different cloud providers are not that vast. But still, if we depend heavily on managed features (backups, replicas, managed replicas, etc.), migrating out of it (even if not out of the cloud provider itself) can be hard.


## PVC + Postgres
### Pros
1. Control
This is the top benefit of self-hosted Postgres: we get full control of almost everything. We control the Postgres version, extensions, OS/kernel parameters, mount options, tuning, and more. We can run almost any extension or custom configuration we need. We can upgrade when we want, run custom versions or forks, and apply patches.

2. Cost
Potentially cheaper at scale if optimized well, because we’re only paying for infrastructure components (compute + storage) without a “management tax.” But it has to be well optimized so that hidden costs like engineer time and potential downtime don’t erode that advantage.

3. Vendor Lock-in / Portability
Lower vendor lock-in, because it is easier to move to another cloud or on-prem, since our deployment is more portable.

### Cons
1. Operational Burden is Much Higher
We must build (or adopt) tooling and processes for everything that comes built-in with a managed service. These include backups, point-in-time recovery, HA/replication, managed failover logic, sharding, monitoring, upgrades, encryption, network policies, RBAC, certificate management, and securing backups.

2. Scalability, Performance, and Reliability
We can actually scale more flexibly (within Kubernetes and our storage limits) and optimize for our workload. At small-to-moderate scale, the performance disadvantage of DBaaS might be negligible. But once we start needing high IOPS, high throughput, low latency, complex queries, huge datasets, or multi-zone writes, the disadvantages (network overhead, abstraction layers) of a managed service may become more noticeable. Since we are responsible for capacity planning for these, mistakes that come from human error in storage class, PV provisioning, volume scaling, or operator bugs can lead to data loss.

3. Time to Deploy / Ease of Use
Slower deployment time because we must design the deployment (StatefulSet + PVCs, storage class, operator, or custom scripts), test failure modes, set up HA, etc. We’d have to go through many more iterations compared to managed DaaS before we find something that fits our use case. Though Postgres and Kubernetes have robust documentation, it still cannot compare to the ease of use and templates that come with private cloud storage DaaS services.

4. Backup and Restore
Running our own Postgres in Kubernetes means taking full responsibility for backup strategy, scheduling, and storage management. We must configure and maintain tools like pgBackRest or WAL-G, handle WAL archiving, and ensure consistency across PersistentVolumes. Testing and automating restores are also on us, adding complexity. Without disciplined monitoring and regular validation, it’s easy for backups to silently fail or become unusable when we need them most.

## In Conclusion
Using a managed database service like Google Cloud SQL drastically reduces operational complexity. Backups, patching, failover, scaling, and monitoring are all automated and integrated into the cloud ecosystem. We can focus on application logic instead of managing database lifecycles and rely on the provider’s SLAs for reliability and recovery. This approach ensures consistent performance and security updates without manual intervention.

Running self-hosted Postgres on Kubernetes gives us full control but also full responsibility. We must manage backups, replication, scaling, and patching as part of the operational burden. That means tracking new Postgres releases, rebuilding container images, rolling out upgrades safely across StatefulSets, and testing for compatibility. Without careful management, the risk of downtime, configuration drift, or data inconsistency increases significantly compared to a managed service.
